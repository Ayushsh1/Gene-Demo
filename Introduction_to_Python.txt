Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming
language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by
Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is widely used in
fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence,
automation, and software development.

Features of Python: - Easy to learn and use - Interpreted language -
Object-oriented - Large standard library - Cross-platform support - Open
source

Basic Syntax: Python uses indentation instead of braces to define code
blocks.

Example: print(“Hello, World!”)

Variables: Variables store data values.

Example: x = 10 name = “Ayush”

Data Types: - int (integer) - float (decimal) - str (string) - bool
(True/False) - list, tuple, set, dictionary

Example: a = 5 b = 3.14 c = “Python”

Control Statements: Python supports conditional and looping statements.

Example: if x > 0: print(“Positive”)

for i in range(5): print(i)

Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code.

Example: def add(a, b): return a + b

Modules: Python programs can be organized into modules and packages.

Applications of Python: - Web development (Django, Flask) - Data science
(NumPy, Pandas) - Machine learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) -
Automation and scripting - Game development

Conclusion: Python is a powerful and versatile programming language
suitable for beginners and professionals. Its simple syntax and vast
ecosystem make it one of the most popular programming languages today.
